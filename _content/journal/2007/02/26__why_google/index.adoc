=  Why Google

"Starting with just one page, www.google.com has become a billion dollars
company now"

Why you should use Google (and its applications),

*  http://www.google.com/[What You Search Is What You Get]
*  http://mail.google.com/[Gmail], 7+ GB email storage, with less spam, and
   still counting for additional free space
*  http://pages.google.com/[Google Pages], 100 MB personal pages
   (out of service, replaced with
   http://sites.google.com/[Google Sites])
*  http://picasaweb.google.com/[PicasaWeb], 250 MB photo album.
*  http://pack.google.com/[Google Pack],

And its all FREE!
