Broken Social Scene - Major Label Debut
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm just coming here to come down
I could be there, I could move town

Put my suits right on the guest list
Saw my passport, Became weightless

And I'm all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up
And I'm all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up

Draper Street caught me believing
Spill their eyes on all the ceilings

Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation, it means I love you

And I'm all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up
And I'm all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up

I'm just coming here to come down
I could be there, I could move town

Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation, it means "I love you"

And I'm all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up
And I'm all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up
