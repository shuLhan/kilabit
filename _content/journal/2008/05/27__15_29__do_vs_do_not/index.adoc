=  Dos and Donts

This is a list of what I have learned from my experience in the past, and I
hope I do not make the same mistake in the future.

If you an Analyst,

*  Do make a good documentation before development.
**  A good documentation can make a fast development.
**  A good documentation can make track every change while in development.
**  A good documentation can make a programmer know about a problem with means
they will know which algorithm or logic is the best that they will applied to
the problem.

If you a DBA,

*  Do not change a field name in table occasionally.
**  Changes in fields name impact to programmer time, and most programmer does
not like it.
**  If you really need to change a field name, make a new field but do not
delete the old one, mark them as an absolute.
*  Trigger is fast but trigger can make you triggered in the late of the night
   after it.
*  Believe me with this one, Oracle suck! do not use it.

If you are a Programmer,

*  Do read and learn. Don't wasting others team with your stupid question,
   what you must do is: Googling.
*  Read,
*  Read,
*  and Read!
*  Then ask your friend, if you cannot solve the problem.
*  Algorithm is cheap, time was expensive! Make or use a fastest algorithm as
   possible!
*  Comment your code, please.
