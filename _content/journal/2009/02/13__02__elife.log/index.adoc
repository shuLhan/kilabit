Opera, the last two release (9.6x) is really buggy, must back to Firefox
2.0.0.18.

Since I am not using Opera anymore, I try to use KMail, for my first
impression it seem OK but let time decided it. No, no Thunderbird for now.

Adblock Plus vs NoScript.
Adblock Plus some time make browser "stack" or stop at some point, but
NoScript fast.
Use NoScript!.

Last kernel update on openSuSE 10.3 make my laptop frequently hang, I cannot
find the cause, but it must be between one of these: kernel, ndiswrapper,
NVidia driver, ndiswrapper, or Opera.
Yes, you Opera.
Since I am already have my own kernel-2.6.git, I try to use it.
But, the last NVidia 180.22 not in good shape, but NVidia look like have a
quick respond and release 180.29 to fix it.

With the latest kernel my kpowersave does not work, always 0% charged, or
could be my battery is broken.

The Beatles.
My first The Beatles album was "1", and that was a great album, giving the big
picture of old music and the band to today generation, and since then I
thought The Beatles was a pop band (in my opinion Rock'n'Roll was like a Pop
version in '60), but after listening to several of their old classic album
like "Yellow Submarine", "Revolver" my thought change.
This band could not be a pop band, it must be some think like a rock but
with... hmmm, what is the word... roll, that's it.

And, the last one, my pet project has been launched www.kilabit.info.

Good night, have a nice dreams, and must... watch those damn-to-many movie!
