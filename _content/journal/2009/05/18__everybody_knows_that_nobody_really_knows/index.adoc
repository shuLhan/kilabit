=  Everybody knows, that nobody really knows

Everybody knows, that nobody really knows: musik Indonesia sekarat semenjak
tahun 1997, setelah Dewa 19 meluncurkan album " Pandawa Lima " dan Potret
dengan album " II ".

Walaupun band dengan nama Dewa 19 masih eksis tapi kualitas musik yang
disuguhkan oleh band tersebut sudah menyimpang jauh dari akarnya.
Way to go Dhani.

Jika anda mengaku mendengarkan musik akhir-akhir ini, itu hanyalah suara
gumaman -yang kebetulan- berirama dari salah satu penduduk Springfield, Homer
Simpsons.

Demikian berita kami hari ini, saya Kent Brockman melaporkan langsung dari
Indonesia.

Next, we will entertains you with the new single from John Legend, "Everybody
Knows", enjoy and stay tune in Channel 6.

John Legend - Everybody Knows

It gets harder every day, but i can`t seem to shake the pain
I`m trying to find the words to say, please say
It`s written all over my face, i can`t
Function the same when you`re not here
I`m calling your name and no one`s there
And i hope one day you`ll see nobody has it easy,
I still can`t believe you found somebody knew
But i wish you the best, i guess.
`cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We`ve heard it all before, that everybody knows
How to make it right, i wish we gave it one more try
One more try
One more try
'cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

I don`t care what the people say
They brought it all in anyway
Baby don`t fill up your head with he-said, she-said
It seems like you just don`t know
The radio`s on, you tuning me out,
I`m trying to speak, you`re turning me down
And i hope one day you`ll see nobody has it easy,
I still can`t believe you found somebody knew

But i wish you the best, i guess.
`cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We`ve heard it all before, that everybody knows
How to make it right, i wish we gave it one more try
One more try
One more try
One more try
`cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

Oh i wish you`d understand
Oh, just an ordinary man
Listen we`d have known
Everybody knows, but nobody really knows
And i know one day you`ll see, nobody has it easy
I still can`t believe you found somebody knew
I wish you the best, i guess.

`cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We`ve heard it all before, that everybody knows
How to make it right, i wish we gave it one more try
One more try
One more try
One more try
`cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows
