=  Slashdot: news for jerks, stuff that latter

Nothing more to say,
http://www.google.com/search?q=slashdot+sucks[Google already full of it].

Here is my list of why,

*  The cripple UI.
*  Stories that does not related to IT or "Nerds" anymore.
   If I want to read about politic or economy I will go to time.com.
*  Comment full of sh*t.
   The main thing that I like in old Slashdot time was their comments.
   They give you, at least, two sides of view that make you "hmm" and know
   others side of Nerds.
