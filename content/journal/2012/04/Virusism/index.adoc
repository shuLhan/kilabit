=  Virusism
:stylesheet: /assets/style.css

I'm thinking about creating virusi-sm movement.

Why? instead of worshiping human, I choose to worship virus because, first,
they were a bad-ass organism which can be found wherever there is life and
have probably existed since living cells first evolved.
Second, they keep the earth clean and balancing them in some others way.
